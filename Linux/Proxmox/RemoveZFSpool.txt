1 Login to Proxmox web gui

2 Find the pool name we want to delete, here we use “test” as pool, “/dev/sdd”
  as the disk for example.

3 Launch Shell from web gui for the Proxmox host/cluster or via SSH

4 Use following commands to unmount and destroy the pool
  umount -f /dev/sdd
  zpool destroy test

5 Format the disks if necessary
  fdisk /dev/sdd
  g
  w
	# Explanation
	  format the disk /dev/sdd
	  Use GPT format
	  Write/Commit the changes 

6 Now we can bring back the Proxmox web gui, look at the /dev/sdd,
  it is now available for other usages.


# final step to remove zpool listing
  #location of zfs pool
    cd /etc/systemd/system/zfs-import.target.wants

  # run this command to remove zfs deleted pool
    systemctl disable zfs-import@<<<zfs pool name>>>
