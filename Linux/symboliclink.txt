Ubuntu users utilize the “ln” command for creating symbolic links in their
system. This command creates hard links by default.


However, you can add the “-s” or the “–symbolic” option if you want

 ln -s [Source_File_Path] [Symbolic_Link_Path]
 
 ln -s [Source_Directory_Path] [Symbolic_Link_Destination_Path]

rm [Symbolic_Link_Path]
unlink [Symbolic_Link_Path]
