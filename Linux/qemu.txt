	3) Look for "PCI Simple Communications Controller"
	4) Right Click -> Update Driver and select on the mounted iso in
	   DRIVE:\vioserial\<OSVERSION>\ where <OSVERSION> is your
	   Windows Version (e.g. 2k12R2 for Windows 2012 R2)
	   
After that, you have to install the qemu-guest-agent:

	1) Go to the mounted ISO in explorer
	2) The guest agent installer is in the directory guest-agent
	3) Execute the installer with double click (either qemu-ga-x86_64.msi
