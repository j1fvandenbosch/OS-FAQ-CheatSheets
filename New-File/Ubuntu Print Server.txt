How to install CUPS
  The first thing we need to do is install the CUPS package.
  Log in to your Ubuntu Server in the data center and issue the command:

	sudo apt-get install cups -y

  Once the installation completes, start and enable the CUPS service with the command:

	sudo systemctl start cups
	sudo systemctl enable cups
	
How to configure CUPS
  Now that CUPS is installed and running, we need to make a few configuration changes.
  To open the CUPS configuration file, issue the command:

	sudo nano /etc/cups/cupsd.conf

  First look for the line:

	Browsing Off
  
  Change that line to:

	Browsing On

  Next, we'll want to be able to access the web-based dashboard.
  To to this, look for the line:

	Listen localhost:631

  Change that line to:

	Port 631

  We also need to make sure that CUPS is listening on all interfaces.
  To do that, look for the section:

	<Location />
	  Order allow,deny
	</Location>

  Change the above section to:

	<Location />
	  Order allow,deny
	  Allow @LOCAL
	</Location>

  You might also want to add access to the web-based Admin console.
  To do this, look for the section:

	<Location /admin>
	  Order allow,deny
	</Location>

  Change that section to:

	<Location /admin>
	  AuthType Default
	  Require valid-user
	  Order allow,deny
	  Allow @LOCAL
	</Location>
	
  Save and close the file.

  Restart the CUPS daemon with the command:

	sudo systemctl restart cups
